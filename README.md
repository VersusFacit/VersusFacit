## 👋 Hi and Hello

I’m Mila Page (she/her) a software engineer on the Core team at dbt Labs. I develop for dbt Core and dbt Core adapters as well as maintain the scripting behind the open source dbt package ecosystem. 

## Technical Interests

👀 I love to solve software problems with the perspective of a former stakeholder!

✍️ I'm keen to divine what makes code 'beautiful.' 

☄️ I'm developing a mathematical mindset in order to furnish better code. This quarter, I'm:
  1. Drilling Python, Go, and Rust. 
  2. Collaborating on utilities used by indie Vtubers.
  3. Building a Linear Algebra library for fun and education.
  4. Traversing Lexi Lambda's [lovely blog](lexi-lambda.github.io) one page at a time
  5. Working through upper division math proofs
 
## Collaborating with me

💞️ I’m always ready to chat about:
- anything mathy that relates to code (or not, pure math is legit)
- open source software and managing an open source community
- data engineering or data warehouse lore
