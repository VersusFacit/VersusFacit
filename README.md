## 👋 Hi and Hello

I’m Mila Page (she/her) a developer relations advocate on the community team at dbt Labs. My role revolves around writing tools, keeping the open-source dbt package ecosystem running, and developing features for hub.getdbt.com.

## Technical Interests

👀 I love marrying the skillsets of developer experience, DevOps and classical software engineering together!

☄️ I'm walking down the [Data Engineer Roadmap](https://github.com/datastacktv/data-engineer-roadmap) to become an expert in Cloud-based data management systems and architectures. This quarter, I'm:
  1. Growing 🌱 my expertise in Discrete Maths, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Pythonic Python
  2. Putting into practice ⚙️ Linux OS fundamentals and scripting[1](https://github.com/VersusFacit/scripts), and the more advanced features of Git.

<!---I've collected cannonical resources on all of these topics and will be creating repositories documenting various segments of this work.--->

## Collaborating with me

💞️ I’m always ready to chat about:
- creation of content discussing and developing the practices of development relations, software community building, and/or analytics engineering
- technical resources used by Latin/Ancient Greek practioners and hobbyists

## Freelancing
