## 👋 Hi and Hello

I’m Mila Page (she/her) a software engineer on the Core team at dbt Labs. I develop dbt adapters and maintain the scripting behind open source dbt package ecosystem. 

## Technical Interests

👀 I love to solve software problems with the perspective of a former stakeholder!

✍️ I'm keen to understand what makes code 'beautiful.' 

☄️ I'm walking down the [Data Engineer Roadmap](https://github.com/datastacktv/data-engineer-roadmap) to become an expert in Cloud-based data management systems and architectures. This quarter, I'm:
  1. Data engineering on hold as I onboard as a fulltime SWE! 
  2. Drilling Python, Shell, and Rust. 
  3. Getting my hands into more open source projects.

<!---I've collected cannonical resources on all of these topics and will be creating repositories documenting various segments of this work.--->

## Collaborating with me

💞️ I’m always ready to chat about:
- open source software and managing an open source community
- data engineering or data warehouse lore
- technical resources used by Latin/Ancient Greek practioners and hobbyists

## Freelancing

📚 Need a technical writer or editor? I edited:
